# Sharper intuitions, stronger foundations, shared curiosity

<p class="lead-text">
The Theory CS Club is a student-led initiative at ISI Kolkata for everyone interested in
algorithms, complexity theory, automata, combinatorics, logic, and related areas. We read papers,
solve problems together, and try to understand the mathematical foundations of computation.
</p>

### Our motto

> To build a small but serious community where people can learn, question, and work on ideas in theoretical computer science together.
