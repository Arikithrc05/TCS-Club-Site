    "text": "Past Talks\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Complexity Theory and Turing Machines\n\n\nSpeaker: Rudrayan Kundu, MStat 1st\n\nIn this talk we give a brief introduction to the models of computation and Turing Machines and how that does not matter. We define the classes P and NP based on our definition of deterministic turing machines.\n\n\n\nSlides (PDF)\n\n\nLecture notes\n\n\nRecording (YouTube)\n\n\nReading Material\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Real Zeros of Dense and Sparse Random Polynomials\n\n\nSpeaker: Arikith Roy Chowdhury, BStat 3rd\n\nThe expected number of real zeros of random polynomials has been a subject of great interest due to its connections with algebraic as well as geometric complexity theory. In this talk we will be exploring the Kac’s integral formula for dense random polynomials and see it’s derivation by Edelman-Kostlan. Thereafter we will see Bürgisser’s upper bound for k-sparse polynomials and a very recent improvement of the bound, making it tight. We will also try to get glimpses into The Real Tau Conjecture and its implications along with recent developments and possible research directions.\n\n\nSession notes\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Papers\n\n\n\nEdelman-Kostlan Paper\n\n\nKac Integral Paper\n\n\nZeros of Sparse Random Polynomial\n\n\nReal Tau true on average\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Real Tau Conjecture is True in Average\n\n\nSpeaker: Arikith Roy Chowdhury, BStat 3rd\n\nThe Real Tau Conjecture is one of those big open problems which, if proven true, have really significant implications in complexity theory and computer science. Although the problem remains opens in general, very recently Burgisser and Briquel were able to show that the conjecture holds true in the average case for random polynomials given by ΣΠΣΠ depth-4 arithmetic circuits. In this talk we will see a sketch of their proof using Rice’s formula and Rice inequality from the theory of random fields along with techniques from multivariate calculus and differential topology. Thereafter we plan to have a philosophical discussion regarding the interpretation of this result and further research directions.\n\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nPaper"

We read papers, solve problems together, and try to understand the mathematical foundations of computation.\n\n\nOur motto\n\nTo build a small but serious community where people can learn, question, and work on ideas in theoretical computer science together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Connected\n\n\nReach out if you want to join the club, suggest a talk, or share resources.\n\n\n\nEmail:  theorycsclub.isi@example.com \n\n\nYouTube:  Our YouTube channel \n\n\nWhatsApp group:  Join the WhatsApp group \n\n\n\nReplace these links with the actual club email, YouTube channel, and WhatsApp invite. New members are always welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we do\n\n\nReading groups, blackboard talks, problem sessions, and informal discussions on core topics in theoretical CS and related mathematics.\n\n\n\n\nTalks\n\n\nWe regularly host short talks by students on topics they find interesting. Slides, notes, and recordings are archived on the Talks page.\n\nSee talks →\n\n\n\nHow to join\n\n\nJust come to a session, or send us an email / message on the WhatsApp group. No background is “too little” as long as you’re curious."
